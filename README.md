# Global AI Index Prediction and Visualization

## Overview

This repository contains a regression model for predicting and visualizing the Global Artificial Intelligence (AI) Index using a Kaggle dataset. The aim of this project is to develop a model that can predict the Global AI Index based on relevant features and then visualize the results in an informative and understandable manner.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle and contains information about various indicators related to global Artificial Intelligence. It consists of several variables, including AI research and development investments, patent counts, number of AI professionals, among others. The dataset has been preprocessed and cleaned to ensure the quality of input data.

## Regression Model

The regression model employed in this project is based on advanced machine learning algorithms. Various algorithms were explored, such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, among others. The model was trained and validated using dataset splitting and cross-validation techniques to ensure its robustness and performance.
